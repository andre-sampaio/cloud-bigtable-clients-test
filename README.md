# Test Framework for Cloud Bigtable Client Libraries

This repository contains the test code that can be used to test the correctness
of Cloud Bigtable
[client libraries](https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/reference/libraries).
Specifically, all of the client libraries should exhibit correct and consistent
behaviors when interacting with the Cloud Bigtable server (e.g. the retry behavior).
Although the client libraries are written in different languages, we don't
expect to have a separate test suite in each language, as it will pose a big
challenge to maintainability and scalability.
